Our project was determining the best neighborhood to commit a murder in.  We used the metrics "Most Illegal Dump Sites", "Most 911 Dispatches", and "Most Arrests" to determine which neighborhood is the best for committing a murder in.  

Illegal Dump Site Dataset - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-illegal-dump-sites/resource/ee834d8d-ae71-4b3b-b02b-312ba321ff17

911 Dispatches Dataset - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-911-dispatches-ems-and-fire/resource/ff33ca18-2e0c-4cb5-bdcd-60a5dc3c0418?view_id=cc95b766-0799-41d3-81e6-6f75513075e6
